# green-house

A fullstack project about smart garden  
We use ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MySQL in this project

### Installation

```
  git clone https://github.com/theksbd/green-house.git
```

Then head into each folder (client and server), type:

```
  npm install
```

to install all necessary packages for the project

### Note

This project also uses [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which will not be installed after you ran the above command (Because I installed it as a global one on my local PC). So you need to install [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) manually if you don't have it yet

```
npm i nodemon
```

### Run Client

```
  npm run client
```

### Run Server

```
  npm run server
```
